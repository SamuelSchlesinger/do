# Decentralized Organization

Instead of decentralized autonomous organizations, we can also make organizations
which have human beings knit into them. This might mean that there are frequent votes
which users have to take part in, or that there are information inputs which allow
the constituent humans to be a part of the nervous system of the organization.

The basic idea is that the organization consists of a number of protocols which the
community organizes around and promotes. These might be a concept of universal basic
income, a new voting mechanism, or really anything, but they are proposed by way of
recommending a new contract to run the entire government. One might say that this way
lies madness, as we're going to allow an authoritarian take control somehow, but I
think we can agree that this problem lies latently within today's democratic
capitalisms. I don't want to dismiss this problem, as I believe its the important
thing to keep in the back of your mind when designing aspects of governance and the ways
of determining consensus.

On to kinder topics, however! The idea here is to have a pattern of organizations, each of
which identify their ancestor and their successor, each identified by some governance pattern.
The key thing that stays the same throughout is the Ancestor class, and it can never
be modified. This allows for one property, if maintained: a linear line of succession from the
seed decentralized organization to exactly one "legitimate" descendant. This may not mean
much if it gets taken over by assholes by then, but at least you'll be able to verify
the line of control if each org obeys this interface. Other than that, I think the users
of this software should have fun, and note that I am not liable for whatever odd
organization lineage you decide to build.
